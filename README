# CasServer

Simple implementation of a Cas Authentication Server. It does not depend on rails but only on active_support and active_record

# Remarks

## Pending

- There is no support for Proxy authentication right now
- There is no single sign out, when a user logout previous service ticket remains active, and local service session too
- Profile management has to be handled and transmitted during /serviceValidate, the design issue to be solved is that it's tgt that could have access to it through authenticator.

## SSO

There is a flow in SSO cookie, they never expires, which means that sessions will always be available.
We need to fix this

# Example

Example goes here.
